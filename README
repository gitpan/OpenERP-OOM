NAME
    OpenERP::OOM - OpenERP Object to Object Mapper

SYNOPSIS
    OpenERP::OOM (Object to Object Mapper) maps OpenERP objects to Perl objects,
    in a similar way to how an ORM like DBIx::Class maps database tables to Perl
    classes.

    Relationships between objects can be defined in Perl code so that the OpenERP
    schema can be traversed using Perl method calls, and related objects can be 
    created by calling methods on their parent (again, this corresponds closely 
    to the relationship model in an ORM).

    Additionally, links can be defined to join OpenERP objects with DBIx::Class
    schemas, so that an OpenERP object can be augmented with additional data
    structures, methods, and application logic that is held outside of OpenERP.

    OpenERP::OOM::Tutorial gives a walkthrough of how to use OpenERP::OOM.
