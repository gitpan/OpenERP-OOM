=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use this module to create the 'classes' for your modules.  It also implicitly loads
Moose too.  In addition to the Moose bindings it also ties up the class with a 
corresponding class for your individual objects using the object_type property.  

=head1 METHODS

=head2 init_meta

This is in internal method that hooks up your class to inherit the class C<OpenERP::OOM::Class::Base>.

See the C<OpenERP::OOM::Class::Base> class for the methods your objects that use 
this class will automatically have available.

=head2 object_type

This links the class to the object class.  When you create a new object using create
or you are returned objects after doing a find or search they will be of the type 
specified.
